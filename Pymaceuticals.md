Pymaceuticals - Three observable trends based on the data 

1. By looking at the tumor volume changes over time by treatment (across entire 45 days), we can conclude that among the four analyzed drugs, "Capomulin" was the only one with positive result in terms of reducing the tumor volume (-19%)

2. By looking at the metastatic sites changes over time by treatment, we found that maximum change was for the drug Ketapril followed by Placebo. 

3. By looking at the mice survival rate over time by treatment, we can infer that the survival rate was highest for the drug Capomulin (above 80%), result that is directly proportional with the trend observed in tumor volume change over time where we saw a volume decrease in the tumor as a result of this treatment.
